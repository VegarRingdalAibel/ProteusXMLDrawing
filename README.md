# ProteusXMLDrawing

Experiment on trying to take dexpi xml and convert to drawing using svg/or canvas lib
Will be some repeated code in many classes, but easier for me while developing..

See spec folder under public for more info


Issues/Need more work:
- add missing attributes/geometry items
- prob should add group/refactor all
- text is hard to work off when these is no lineheight/fontsize, not sure how justification is supposed to work without this
- TrimmedCurve
- BsplineCurve
- CompositeCurve
- rotation of items/text

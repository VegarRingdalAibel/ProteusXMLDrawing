# ProteusXMLDrawing

Experiment on trying to take dexpi xml and convert to drawing using svg/or canvas lib
Will be some repeated code in many classes, but easier for me while developing..

See spec folder under public for more info


Issues/Need more work:
- add missing attributes/geometry items
- prob should add group/refactor all
- text is hard to work off when these is no lineheight/fontsize, not sure how justification is supposed to work without this
- TrimmedCurve ( have a plan... just need to bruch up some math first..)
- BsplineCurve (not seen these used...)
- CompositeCurve (not seen these used...)
- rotation/scale of items -> this will need some work..
- not added a lot of the attributes... only the ones I needed to for drawing++
